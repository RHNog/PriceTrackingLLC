# Roadmap

This is the engineering roadmap. Product-facing ideas now live in `docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`. Business strategy lives in `docs/BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md`. Monetization options live in `docs/MONETIZATION.md`. Unscoped ideas live in `docs/IDEA_LEDGER.md`.

## Current Sprint: Sprint 34

Market Intelligence now interprets provider observations into explainable market profiles.

- Connected: Market Intelligence Engine, reasoning model, signal registry, market health, buying opportunity, confidence, trend interpretation, and volatility interpretation.
- Verified: replay-only market intelligence generation for Mox Opal, Chrome Mox, Lightning Bolt, Black Lotus, Collected Company, and Urza's Saga.
- Deferred: provider connections, repository redesign, ontology redesign, business-profile influence, negotiation behavior, BUY/PASS decisions, and UI redesign.
- Compatibility: the engine consumes repository observations and replay-normalized observations; providers remain acquisition-only and business engines remain downstream.

## Recently Completed: Sprint 33

Provider Replay lets development replay certified provider observations without using live APIs.

- Connected: replay fixture infrastructure, fixture validation, replay sessions, replay diagnostics, JustTCG fixture replay, and optional fixture recording.
- Verified: seeded replay fixtures for Mox Opal, Chrome Mox, Lightning Bolt, Black Lotus, Collected Company, and Urza's Saga compile through the provider path.
- Deferred: production replay mode, repository-specific fixture awareness, business engine changes, and provider administration UI.
- Compatibility: production remains live; repository and business engines receive the same provider-shaped observations regardless of live or replay source.

## Recently Completed: Sprint 32

Market Ontology now defines what each market evidence domain means and which providers can answer each domain.

- Connected: evidence domains, provider capability matrix, evidence question resolution, domain coverage, JustTCG supported/unsupported domains, scheduler provider eligibility, and validation filtering.
- Connected: coverage-driven market refresh so fresh snapshots still fetch missing evidence domains.
- Verified: known-card ontology resolution for Mox Opal, Chrome Mox, Black Lotus, Lightning Bolt, Collected Company, and Urza's Saga.
- Deferred: multi-provider consensus, Atlas visual capability matrix, production provenance UI, new live providers, and recommendation changes.
- Compatibility: Current Market Estimate temporarily projects JustTCG Variant Valuation until the Market Intelligence Engine owns the field directly.

## Recently Completed: Sprint 31D

Market Evidence Layer now selects best available market evidence from layered provider contributions.

- Connected: evidence aggregation, resolver, provider priority, provenance, coverage, fallback chains, and repository selection.
- Verified: known-card evidence stacking preserves populated fields and adds new provider fields.
- Deferred: provider consensus, production provenance UI, new providers, and Assessment/Strategy/Negotiation changes.

## Recently Completed: Sprint 31C

Market Truth Model is now the validation layer for provider evidence.

- Connected: provider match validation, price classification, evidence scoring, and Market Truth reports.
- Verified: known-card evidence validation for Mox Opal, Chrome Mox, Black Lotus, Lightning Bolt, Collected Company, and Urza's Saga.
- Deferred: multi-provider consensus, cache redesign, additional live providers, Assessment changes, recommendation changes, and production UI exposure.

## Previously Completed: Sprint 31B

Market Intelligence Repository is now the infrastructure owner for market snapshots.

- Connected: local repository persistence and per-field refresh policy.
- Verified: first request provider call, second request repository hit, and independent expired-field refresh.
- Deferred: database-backed persistence, distributed background workers, and repository admin UI.

## Previously Completed: Sprint 31A

JustTCG is connected through the official `justtcg-js` SDK as the first live provider connection.

- Connected: official SDK initialization with `JUSTTCG_API_KEY`.
- Verified: known-card Mox Opal request, normalized response, provider diagnostics, and developer-only inspection page.
- Deferred: caching, retries, Assessment integration, Strategy integration, Negotiation integration, Decision integration, and production UI exposure.

## Provider Backlog

- Add Atlas visual capability matrix for Market Ontology domains and providers.
- Remove Transitional Evidence Projection when the Market Intelligence Engine owns Current Market Estimate.
- Add consensus rules for domains with multiple connected providers.
- Add domain-level provider priority configuration once provider administration exists.
- Add future Market Consensus Engine after multiple validated providers are available.
- Add production-safe provider provenance display if a future product surface needs it.
- Expand provider identity evidence coverage for collector number, language, product identifiers, and provider timestamps.
- Add retry policy through Provider SDK hooks.
- Add provider cache through Provider SDK cache hooks.
- Expand known-card connectivity into provider-backed card lookup flows.
- Keep raw SDK responses restricted to development-only tooling.
