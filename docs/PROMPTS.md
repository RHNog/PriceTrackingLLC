# Prompt History

## PHR-ARCH-004

Purpose: transform identity into a provider-agnostic platform.

Core instruction: UI and workflows consume the Identity Engine; orchestration owns registry selection, adapter normalization, provider lifecycle, canonical identity, and diagnostics.

Result: Scryfall is an operational Magic registration; PHR-API-001 subsequently made Lorcast operational for Lorcana; three future games remain pending.

## PHR-API-001

Purpose: connect the first non-Magic Identity Provider.

Core instruction: treat Lorcast strictly as identity, request all printings, normalize canonical metadata and artwork, cache responsibly, and discard provider prices.

Result: Lorcast now supplies operational Lorcana identities through the existing registry and orchestrator with no UI or workflow redesign.

## PHR-UX-002

Purpose: make the global command palette the canonical platform interaction entry point.

Core instruction: orchestrate the existing Universal Asset Picker and route completed selections without creating search or business logic.

Result: a Cards-mode palette now supports debounced identity-only search, eligibility, artwork, printing, finish, condition, keyboard navigation, and context actions.

## PHR-UI-001

Purpose: make artwork a canonical part of asset identity across Project Phronesis.

Core instruction: reuse provider identity, remain provider-agnostic, cache images, never show broken images, and design the hierarchy for future previews, actions, and overlays.

Result: `CardThumbnail` now anchors Market Watch and Universal Asset Picker results through a shared image cache and fallback system.

This file summarizes major prompts and architectural instructions. It intentionally avoids copying every prompt in full.

## PHR-TECH-001

Purpose: establish the Documentation-First Development System.

Core instruction: documentation is part of implementation. Every meaningful change must be classified, assigned or linked to a permanent Feature ID, documented through an implementation-grade specification, and paired with an AI-ready implementation prompt when implementation work is required.

Major files affected: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION_FIRST_DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/templates/FeatureSpecificationTemplate.md`, `docs/templates/ImplementationPromptTemplate.md`, `docs/technical/PHR-TECH-001-documentation-first-development-system.md`, `docs/prompts/PHR-TECH-001-implementation-prompt.md`, and documentation taxonomy folders under `docs/`.

Result: future AI-assisted engineering work has a repository-level process for documentation, classification, traceability, and reusable implementation prompts.

## Sprint 33

Purpose: introduce Provider Replay & Fixture Infrastructure.

Core instruction: production acquires provider observations, development replays provider observations, and the application should behave identically in both modes.

Major files affected: `lib/providers/replay/`, `lib/providers/justtcg/JustTCGProvider.ts`, JustTCG developer diagnostics, provider replay fixtures, provider replay tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: development can run JustTCG provider flows from certified fixtures in `REPLAY` or `AUTO` mode without network calls or quota usage, while production remains live and downstream repository/business layers stay unaware.

## Sprint 32

Purpose: introduce the Market Ontology.

Core instruction: providers contribute observations, observations belong to evidence domains, evidence domains feed Market Intelligence, and providers must never answer outside their capability.

Major files affected: `lib/market/ontology/`, market refresh scheduling, provider evidence validation, evidence fallback language, JustTCG provider semantics, market ontology tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: market questions now resolve to semantic domains before provider selection. JustTCG is registered for variant valuation, historical pricing, price trend, volatility, market confidence, and provider metadata, and explicitly unsupported for listing, transaction, and inventory intelligence.

## Sprint 31D

Purpose: introduce the Market Evidence Layer.

Core instruction: every provider contributes evidence, evidence is layered, and adding a provider must never reduce available market information.

Major files affected: `lib/market/`, Market Intelligence Repository, Market Refresh Scheduler, JustTCG developer inspection page, Market Evidence tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: provider evidence now stacks by field, repository snapshots preserve existing populated fields, provider priorities and fallback chains drive best-available selection, and developer tooling can inspect provenance and coverage.

## Sprint 31C

Purpose: introduce the Market Truth Model.

Core instruction: the repository stores provider evidence, not truth. Provider responses must be validated, classified, scored, and attributed before they become Market Intelligence Repository values.

Major files affected: `lib/market/`, JustTCG developer inspection page, market repository snapshot contracts, market repository scheduler, Market Truth tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: selected-printing market provider responses now pass through provider match validation, price classification, evidence scoring, and Market Truth reporting before repository writes. Consensus, extra providers, cache redesign, Assessment changes, and recommendation changes remain deferred.

## Sprint 31B

Purpose: introduce the Market Intelligence Repository.

Core instruction: provider responses should become repository-owned Market Intelligence. Providers update the repository, Asset Session consumes repository snapshots, and business logic must not communicate directly with providers.

Major files affected: `lib/market/`, market snapshot API route, Vendor Workspace market request context, repository tests, local persistence ignore rule, and Atlas documentation.

Result: market snapshots now flow through repository freshness checks with per-field TTLs, local persistence, statistics, and diagnostics.

## Sprint 31A

Purpose: establish the first live provider connection.

Core instruction: integrate the official `justtcg-js` SDK through the Provider SDK, authenticate with `JUSTTCG_API_KEY`, retrieve one known card, normalize SDK fields, and keep raw SDK data out of production application flows.

Major files affected: `lib/providers/justtcg/`, `ProviderRegistry`, `/dev/justtcg`, package dependency files, provider tests, environment example, and Atlas documentation.

Result: JustTCG SDK authentication was validated with a known-card Mox Opal request, normalization mappings were documented, and a temporary developer-only inspection page was added.

## Sprint 30

Purpose: integrate the first real Intelligence Provider.

Core instruction: integrate TCGplayer as the primary Market Intelligence Provider through the Provider SDK, convert provider data into evidence, and never expose raw API responses.

Major files affected: TCGplayer market provider, market snapshot contracts, market signal generation, offer ladder spread/liquidity logic, Atlas Provider Trace, tests, and documentation.

Result: provider-backed Market Intelligence evidence for liquidity, inventory health, sales velocity, spread, confidence, volatility, stability, and demand momentum.

## Sprint 29

Purpose: create a reusable Intelligence Provider SDK.

Core instruction: every future provider should follow the same lifecycle; providers supply data while SDK infrastructure owns normalization, health, caching hooks, diagnostics, evidence mapping, confidence contribution, metadata, retry hooks, and validation hooks.

Major files affected: `lib/providers/sdk/`, Atlas Inspector provider diagnostics, provider SDK tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: generic provider contracts, planned metadata-only adapters for EDHREC, PSA, BGS, CGC, Cardmarket, TCGplayer, Melee, MTGO, LigaMagic, and eBay, and Atlas-visible provider health, coverage, and evidence contribution.

## Sprint 28

Purpose: introduce the Asset Assessment Engine.

Core instruction: Intelligence Models provide evidence; Asset Assessment interprets evidence; Business Profile, Strategy, Negotiation, and Decision remain separate downstream layers.

Major files affected: `lib/assessment/`, Card Profile, Asset Intelligence Framework registry, strategy scoring, business profile explanation, Intelligence Console tile content, tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: deterministic assessment with overall assessment, confidence, evidence coverage, primary drivers, supporting drivers, risk factors, opportunity factors, and business summary.

## Sprint 26

Purpose: mature Playability Intelligence from Level 2 to Level 3.

Core instruction: introduce richer playability semantics without live third-party integrations.

Major files affected: Playability demand/role/adapter contracts, Playability engine/profile, tests, Intelligence Registry metadata, and Atlas documentation.

Result: normalized demand dimensions, provider-ready adapter, card role classification, role-aware conclusions, and key signals.

## Sprint 25.1

Purpose: introduce the Evidence Sufficiency Framework.

Core instruction: intelligence models must never produce definitive conclusions without sufficient supporting evidence.

Major files affected: Intelligence framework evidence contracts, Asset Intelligence Framework model definitions, Intelligence Console grade display, Atlas Inspector diagnostics, tests, and documentation.

Result: required/optional/future evidence declarations, Unknown state, low-confidence evidence explanations, and model-wide evidence sufficiency reports.

## Sprint 25

Purpose: mature Playability Intelligence from Level 1 Framework to Level 2 Meaningful Intelligence.

Core instruction: Playability should stop reporting legality and begin evaluating why the market cares about a card.

Major files affected: `config/playability.ts`, Playability Intelligence engine/profile/indicators, framework registry metadata, Playability tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: weighted format demand, natural-language business conclusions, key signals, richer per-format Playability indicators, and future provider hooks without unofficial API integrations.

## Sprint 24.2

Purpose: finalize Intelligence Console presentation without layout redesign, business logic changes, or intelligence calculation changes.

Core instruction: every Intelligence model should answer what it thinks, how certain it is, why, and what evidence supports it.

Major files affected: Intelligence Console components, tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: redundant Summary and What This Means sections removed, confidence is model-specific and explained below High, Key Signals and Supporting Evidence are final labels, and expanded tile state persists for the current session.

## Sprint 24.1

Purpose: redesign Intelligence Console information architecture without changing business engines or intelligence calculations.

Core instruction: production users should see business conclusions, not implementation details.

Major files affected: Intelligence Console components, Atlas Inspector, tests, and documentation.

Result: Vendor Workspace shows model name, grade, confidence label, business conclusion, supporting indicators, and evidence. Atlas Inspector retains versions, health, status, future dependencies, internal signals, debug information, and provider matrix.

## Sprint 24

Purpose: introduce the Certification Intelligence Platform.

Core instruction: create Certification Intelligence as another first-class Asset Intelligence model that measures collectible certification characteristics and never decides BUY/PASS.

Major files affected: `lib/intelligence/certification/`, Asset Intelligence Framework, Card Intelligence, Intelligence Console, tests, and Atlas documentation.

Result: provider-ready Certification Profile with placeholder PSA, BGS, and CGC coverage, future provider status, Collector Intelligence consumption, and no scraping or unofficial APIs.

## Sprint 0

Purpose: set up the project.

Core instruction: create a Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind application.

Major files affected: project root, `app/`, config files.

Result: working Next.js application.

## Sprint 1

Purpose: create the application shell and initial dashboard.

Core instruction: build a dark app shell with reusable sidebar/topbar components.

Major files affected: `components/ui/`, `app/page.tsx`.

Result: reusable shell and dashboard foundation.

## Sprint 2

Purpose: turn Watchlists into buying strategies.

Core instruction: model watchlists as professional buyer workflows.

Major files affected: `components/watchlists/`, `data/mockWatchlists.ts`, `types/watchlist.ts`.

Result: watchlist strategy UI.

## Sprint 3

Purpose: make Hot Opportunities the home page.

Core instruction: display buying opportunities instead of a generic dashboard.

Major files affected: `components/opportunities/`, `types/opportunity.ts`, `data/mockOpportunities.ts`.

Result: Opportunity Engine foundation.

## Sprints 4-8

Purpose: add scoring, profit, provider, ranking, and strategy engines.

Result: provider-independent decision architecture.

## Sprint 9

Purpose: introduce Vendor Workspace.

Core instruction: create a fast command-palette-style purchase evaluation workflow.

Major files affected: `features/vendor/`, `app/vendor/page.tsx`.

Result: search, select, asking price, evaluate workflow.

## Sprint 11

Purpose: add Scryfall Identity Provider and diagnostics.

Core instruction: validate raw provider data, adapter output, and normalized domain cards.

Major files affected: `lib/providers/identity/`, `features/developer/identity/`.

Result: development-only Identity Explorer.

## Sprint 12

Purpose: introduce Universal Query Engine.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/query/`, `knowledge/`, `types/parsedQuery.ts`.

Result: dictionary-driven query parsing.

## Sprint 12.5

Purpose: add Intent Resolution.

Core instruction: separate identity meaning from printing constraints.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/intent/`.

Result: resolved identity and constraints.

## Sprint 12.6

Purpose: add Entity Resolution.

Core instruction: understand relationships like primary card, back face, token, emblem, split card.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/entity/`, `config/relationships.ts`.

Result: relationship-aware identity ranking.

## Sprint 12.7

Purpose: add Canonical Resolution.

Core instruction: resolve professional shorthand before intent resolution.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/canonical/`, `knowledge/shared/canonical/`.

Result: `bolt`, `fow`, `bob`, `monkey`, and similar terms resolve to canonical identities.

## Sprint 12.8

Purpose: add Constraint Satisfaction.

Core instruction: rank printings after identity resolution using parsed constraints.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/constraints/`, `features/vendor/components/PrintingResults.tsx`.

Result: Vendor Workspace avoids unrelated default printings.

## Sprint 12.9

Purpose: add Prefix Matching.

Core instruction: resolve progressive typed vocabulary like `invocatio` without overmatching short fragments.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/query/`, `config/query.ts`.

Result: safer progressive query resolution.

## Sprint 13

Purpose: add visual printing confirmation and recover documentation.

Core instruction: images are part of purchase evaluation and must come from normalized domain objects.

Major files affected: `types/card.ts`, `ScryfallAdapter.ts`, `features/vendor/`, `docs/`.

Result: Vendor Workspace card images and project documentation system.

## Sprint 14

Purpose: introduce the first live Market Provider.

Core instruction: use Scryfall prices as daily market estimates, not live listings.

Major files affected: `lib/providers/market/`, `types/marketPrice.ts`, `features/vendor/`.

Result: Vendor Workspace can use normalized market estimates.

## Sprint 15

Purpose: add default variant resolution and complete purchase evaluation.

Core instruction: default multi-finish printings through a reusable policy and return BUY / NEGOTIATE / PASS.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/variantResolution/`, `lib/engines/evaluation/`, `features/vendor/`.

Result: Vendor Workspace completes the first end-to-end buying workflow.

## Sprint 16

Purpose: optimize Vendor Workspace for real buying sessions.

Core instruction: make the decision visible immediately, reduce scrolling, remove repeated explanations, and synchronize Atlas.

Major files affected: `features/vendor/`, `lib/engines/decision/`, `docs/`.

Result: Decision-first workspace with sticky decision panel and Decision Drivers.

## Sprint 17

Purpose: optimize Vendor Workspace VX for professional in-person buying speed.

Core instruction: reduce scrolling and eye movement, make BUY / NEGOTIATE / PASS focal, compress printing rows, replace the manual Evaluate action with automatic debounced evaluation, add chip-based printing refinement, and preserve normal keyboard input behavior.

Major files affected: `features/vendor/`, `components/ui/CardImage.tsx`, `docs/`.

Result: denser command-palette-style Vendor Workspace with automatic decisions, compact printing rows, finish segmented controls, ESC reset, and keyboard printing navigation.

## Sprint 18

Purpose: introduce the Card Intelligence Platform.

Core instruction: stop evaluating price alone; evaluate Card, Printing, Variant, Condition, Market Context, and Strategy through reusable intelligence signals, then convert strategy into negotiation through a Negotiation Ladder before the Decision Resolver compares asking price.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/cardIntelligence/`, `lib/engines/negotiation/`, `lib/engines/decision/`, `lib/engines/evaluation/`, `types/`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

Result: Card Profile, Signal Registry, signal versioning, condition-adjusted market snapshots, Market Context foundation, Negotiation Ladder Engine, deterministic Decision Resolver invariants, Vendor Workspace condition selection, and Card Profile signal panel.

## Sprint 20

Purpose: introduce the Asset Intelligence Framework.

Core instruction: stop creating isolated scoring engines; every future intelligence platform should plug into one model and indicator framework. Intelligence Models measure asset dimensions, strategies consume models, Negotiation Ladder consumes strategies, and Decision Resolver consumes the ladder.

Major files affected: `lib/intelligence/framework/`, `lib/engines/cardIntelligence/`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

Result: Asset Intelligence Framework, Intelligence Model contract, Indicator contract, model registry, indicator registry, model health, status metadata, dependency graph metadata, and Vendor Workspace compatibility through `CardProfile.intelligenceModels`.

## Sprint 20.1

Purpose: stabilize Vendor Workspace with a deterministic workflow state machine.

Core instruction: do not redesign the UI or change business logic. Separate candidate, highlighted, and selected identities; apply the Single Printing Rule; add diagnostics; and guarantee every successful identity selection reaches `ReadyForEvaluation` or `Error`.

Major files affected: `types/VendorWorkflowState.ts`, `lib/workflow/VendorWorkflowMachine.ts`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

Result: deterministic Vendor Workflow states, identity highlight vs selection separation, Single Printing Rule auto-progression, workflow diagnostics, loading and error states, and regression tests for the key workflow paths.

## Sprint 20.2

Purpose: introduce Evaluation Integrity.

Core instruction: incorrect decisions are worse than missing decisions. Validate Offer Ladder output, prevent fallback zero calculations, trace every intermediate calculation, and ensure Decision Resolver consumes validated output only.

Major files affected: `lib/engines/evaluation/`, `lib/engines/negotiation/`, `lib/engines/profit/`, `features/vendor/`, `features/evaluation/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

Result: Offer Ladder Validator, explicit ready/unavailable/invalid evaluation states, Profit Trace, Offer Ladder Trace, Strategy Trace, Decision Trace, development-only Evaluation Trace UI, and evaluation integrity regression coverage.

## Sprint 20.3

Purpose: stabilize workflow ownership.

Core instruction: workflow owns selected state; UI renders workflow context. Add workflow events, context invalidation, atomic rejected transitions, and diagnostics for invalidated/loaded objects.

Major files affected: `types/WorkflowEvent.ts`, `types/VendorWorkflowState.ts`, `lib/workflow/`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

Result: Vendor Workflow Machine owns highlighted identity, selected identity, selected printing, selected variant, selected condition, selected strategy, and asking price. Context invalidation is centralized and rejected transitions no longer partially update UI context.

## Sprint 20.4

Purpose: replace Workflow Event architecture with Workflow Command architecture.

Core instruction: users perform commands and the Workflow Engine performs transitions. UI components dispatch commands such as `SelectCard`, `SelectPrinting`, `SelectVariant`, `SelectCondition`, `ChangeStrategy`, `EnterAskingPrice`, and `ResetWorkspace`; the command processor owns state, invalidation, Single Printing Rule behavior, and diagnostics.

Major files affected: `lib/workflow/commands/`, `types/VendorWorkflowState.ts`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/vendor-workflow-machine.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: command-driven Vendor Workspace orchestration with automatic context invalidation, rejected command safety, command logs, and reusable command architecture for future workspaces.

## Sprint 20.5

Purpose: introduce Asset Context Integrity and Atlas Developer Tools.

Core instruction: every evaluation is performed on one generated asset context: identity, printing, variant, condition, market context, card intelligence, offer ladder, and decision. The workflow owns context generation and validation; production UI does not expose diagnostics.

Major files affected: `types/AssetContext.ts`, `lib/workflow/AssetContextValidator.ts`, `lib/workflow/commands/`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/vendor-workflow-machine.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: Asset Context generation, stale market snapshot rejection, context validation, development-only Atlas Inspector, and production Vendor Workspace diagnostics removal.

## Sprint 20.6

Purpose: restore condition-aware market pricing after the Asset Context refactor.

Core instruction: preserve existing condition pricing behavior. Condition changes must create a new Asset Context generation, invalidate downstream objects, request a fresh Market Snapshot, and feed the existing condition-aware market snapshot pipeline without placeholder pricing.

Major files affected: `lib/workflow/commands/`, `features/vendor/`, `tests/vendor-workflow-machine.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: `ChangeCondition` command, generation-aware `LoadMarketSnapshot`, restored NM/LP/MP/HP/DMG market refresh, Atlas Inspector provider trace additions, and documented Market Provider precedence.

## Sprint 21

Purpose: introduce the Intelligence History Platform.

Core instruction: never lose a completed evaluation. Every `READY` evaluation should become an immutable, append-only historical intelligence snapshot without changing Vendor Workspace UX, Offer Ladder calculations, or Card Intelligence calculations.

Major files affected: `types/EvaluationSnapshot.ts`, `types/AssetSnapshot.ts`, `types/MarketSnapshotHistory.ts`, `types/StrategySnapshot.ts`, `types/OfferLadderSnapshot.ts`, `lib/history/`, `features/vendor/components/PurchasePanel.tsx`, `tests/evaluation-history.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: Evaluation History Engine, append-only repository abstraction, snapshot factory, snapshot validator, local completed-evaluation recording, snapshot regression tests, and Atlas documentation for future Simulation Platform work.

## Sprint 22

Purpose: introduce the Playability Intelligence Platform.

Core instruction: PriceTrackingLLC should understand why a card is valuable from play demand. Playability measures only; strategies interpret it, the Negotiation Ladder consumes strategies, and the Decision Resolver consumes the ladder.

Major files affected: `lib/intelligence/playability/`, `lib/intelligence/framework/`, `lib/engines/cardIntelligence/`, `lib/providers/identity/adapters/ScryfallAdapter.ts`, `features/vendor/components/CardProfilePanel.tsx`, `tests/playability-intelligence.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: provider-ready Playability architecture, Scryfall legalities provider, format indicators, Card Profile integration, framework registration, strategy signal weighting, Intelligence Console v2, reusable Intelligence Tiles, grade mapping, progressive disclosure, and provider roadmap.

## Sprint 23

Purpose: introduce the Business Profiles Platform.

Core instruction: recommendations should be business-aware. Business Profiles supply cost, marketplace, shipping, payment, tax, margin, ROI, negotiation, and risk assumptions; Offer Ladder consumes them while Decision Resolver remains deterministic.

Major files affected: `lib/business/`, `lib/engines/evaluation/`, `lib/engines/negotiation/`, `lib/engines/profit/`, `features/vendor/`, `features/settings/`, `app/settings/page.tsx`, `tests/business-profiles.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: built-in Business Profiles, marketplace templates, cost-aware profit and offer ladder calculations, Vendor Workspace profile selector, Settings profile management surface, business-aware regression coverage, and Atlas synchronization.

## Sprint 23.1

Purpose: introduce the System Readiness Platform.

Core instruction: validate every prerequisite before Strategy, Offer Ladder, and Decision Resolver execution. Separate configuration problems, missing data, business rule failures, calculation failures, and internal errors.

Major files affected: `lib/validation/`, `lib/engines/evaluation/`, `lib/engines/negotiation/OfferLadderValidator.ts`, `features/vendor/components/AtlasInspector.tsx`, `features/vendor/components/EvaluationSummary.tsx`, `tests/system-readiness.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: centralized readiness engine, readiness reports on evaluations, developer-only Atlas readiness diagnostics, user-facing readiness blockers, optional Playability warning behavior, and removal of the negative negotiation margin implementation-error path.

## Sprint 23.2

Purpose: restore evaluation pipeline integrity.

Core instruction: inspect Asset Context, Market Snapshot, Business Profile, Cost Profile, Offer Policy, Strategy, Offer Ladder, and Decision to find the first point where valid evaluation data becomes invalid. Do not redesign UI, Business Profiles, Offer Ladder, or Strategy.

Major files affected: `lib/pipeline/`, `lib/business/`, `lib/engines/evaluation/evaluatePurchase.ts`, `lib/engines/negotiation/`, `features/vendor/components/AtlasInspector.tsx`, `features/vendor/components/VendorWorkspace.tsx`, `features/settings/components/BusinessProfilesSettings.tsx`, `tests/pipeline-integrity.test.ts`, `docs/`.

Result: Pipeline Inspector, explicit business-owned Offer Policy, developer-only Pipeline Trace, first-invalid-stage termination, zero-valued Offer Ladder blocking, Online Marketplace low-dollar policy correction, and regression coverage for a $34.01 market estimate with a $5 seller ask.
