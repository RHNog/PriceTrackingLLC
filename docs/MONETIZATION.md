# Monetization

This document captures monetization possibilities for PriceTrackingLLC. It does not choose a final pricing model.

## Monetization Philosophy

The platform should charge for valuable intelligence and operational leverage, not for arbitrary page views.

A fair monetization model should:

- Align price with new intelligence generation.
- Reward cached intelligence reuse.
- Avoid charging repeatedly for the same fresh insight.
- Scale from solo professional buyers to stores and enterprise partners.
- Preserve trust through explainable billing events.
- Reflect internal provider costs without exposing provider complexity to customers.

## Internal And External Economy Alignment

The customer credit economy should mirror the internal Provider Economy.

Internal:

- Provider observations are cached to reduce API costs.
- Repository snapshots reduce repeated provider calls.
- Replay fixtures reduce development provider usage.
- Freshness windows avoid unnecessary refreshes.

External:

- Generated intelligence is cached to reduce customer credit consumption.
- Repeated viewing of the same fresh intelligence costs zero additional credits.
- Batch workflows should charge per unique asset requiring new intelligence, not per repeated display.
- Manual refresh can consume credits because it explicitly requests regenerated intelligence.

The platform rewards efficiency on both sides.

## Intelligence Credit Economy

The Intelligence Credit Economy is a candidate model, not yet selected.

Core idea:

- Charge credits when new intelligence is generated.
- Charge zero credits for repeated viewing of cached intelligence within a freshness window.
- Charge for manual refresh when the user requests new intelligence.
- Charge batch evaluation by unique asset requiring fresh intelligence.
- Include monthly credit allocations in future subscription plans.

Example:

```text
First evaluation of Mox Opal today
  -> 1 Credit

Second evaluation of Mox Opal today
  -> 0 Credits

Manual Refresh
  -> 1 Credit

Batch Evaluation
  -> Credits per unique asset requiring fresh intelligence
```

## Possible Plan Dimensions

- Number of seats.
- Monthly included credits.
- Shared team cache.
- Provider-backed intelligence depth.
- Batch evaluation limits.
- Inventory size.
- Portfolio size.
- Alert count.
- Marketplace integrations.
- API access.
- Historical analytics.
- Multi-store support.
- White-label rights.

## Open Questions

- Should credits be the primary model or a supplement to subscriptions?
- Should every workflow consume the same credit type?
- How should partial provider data affect credits?
- Should failed provider calls consume credits?
- How long should freshness windows last?
- Should high-cost provider refreshes cost more credits?
- Should team members share intelligence freshness and credits?
- Should manually refreshed intelligence reset the freshness window for all users in an account?
- How should billing explain why a credit was or was not consumed?
