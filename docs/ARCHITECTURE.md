# Architecture

## Application Structure

PriceTrackingLLC is a Next.js application using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Top-level structure:

- `app/`: Next.js routes and API routes.
- `components/`: shared UI and reusable product components.
- `features/`: workflow-specific UI modules.
- `types/`: domain contracts shared across engines and UI.
- `data/`: mocked domain data.
- `knowledge/`: dictionary-driven TCG knowledge.
- `config/`: configurable engine thresholds and weights.
- `lib/engines/`: provider-independent business and interpretation engines.
- `lib/providers/`: external or mocked data provider implementations.

## App Shell

`components/ui/AppShell.tsx` owns the application frame:

- Sidebar navigation
- Topbar
- Main content area

Feature routes compose their UI inside `AppShell`.

## Feature Modules

Feature-specific presentation lives in `features/`.

Examples:

- `features/vendor/`: Vendor Workspace and purchase evaluation UI.
- `features/developer/identity/`: development-only Identity Explorer and diagnostics.
- `features/opportunities/`: Opportunity Details.
- `features/evaluation/`: Purchase Evaluation form and result components.

Generic UI should remain in `components/ui`.

## Provider Architecture

Identity Providers answer:

What is this card?

Market Providers answer:

What is this card worth?

These provider families must stay separate.

Current state:

- Scryfall is the first Identity Provider.
- Market pricing is still mocked.
- UI components must never know Scryfall response shapes.
- Provider data must be adapted into domain objects before it reaches engines or UI.

## Image Architecture

Card images are presentation data attached to normalized `Card` domain objects.

The Scryfall adapter maps provider image data into:

- `imageUrl`
- `imageUrls`
- `cardFaces`
- `imageSource`
- `imageFace`
- `hasCardFaces`

UI components render images from domain objects only. They must not fetch Scryfall image data directly.

## Engine Rules

- Business engines must remain provider-independent.
- Query, canonical, intent, entity, and constraint engines must remain independent from React.
- UI components render data and user controls; they do not calculate business values.
- Dictionaries and config files should evolve before parser logic is rewritten.
